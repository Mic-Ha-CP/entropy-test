These are summarised into the five sub-dimensions above. Each dimension is scored from 1 to 5 to indicate its current strength. If one sub-dimension is about 25% higher or lower than your personal mean across the five, it can be treated as a relatively pronounced strength or weakness, and may be a good priority for your next round of reflection and practice.",
